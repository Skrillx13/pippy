Pippy is a blazingly fast, extremely simply, and multi-problem solving package manager. It was built based on the foundations of `pip`, Pythons default package manager, and still retains a similar approach to package management.

## How it Works:

Pippy works in a almost-identical way to `pip`, with a few exceptions.

The first one is automatically creating virtual enviroments upon installing packages. The second one, is automatically creating a `pippy` file, that works similarly to a `requirements.txt`file. And finally, the third one is a better warning system that warns the user whenever packages have conflicts.

Pippy's logic is that package management should be simple, but still helpful and "batteries-included", and should also be able to be shared with others in a working space.
